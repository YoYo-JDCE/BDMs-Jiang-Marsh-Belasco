This depository stores the code for the research paper "Optimizing Microplastic Pollution in a Terrestrial Environment: A Case for Soil-Biodegradable Mulches" authored by Jingze Jiang, Thomas Marsh, and Eric Belasco <br />
The corresponding author: Dr. Jingze Jiang, jjiang@pennwest.edu

To be able to run the code, one needs to install the following MATLAB toolbox: <br />
1. Database Toolbox <br />
2. Econometrics Toolbox <br />
3. Financial Toolbox <br />
4. Optimization Toolbox <br />
5. Statistics and ML toolbox <br />
6. Symbolic Math Toolbox <br />
One must also download the CompEcon Toolbox authored by Paul Fackler or Mario Miranda. The CompEcon Toolbox was developed to accompany: <br />
Applied Computational Economics and Finance, Mario J. Miranda & Paul L. Fackler, MIT Press <br />

## Basic analysis
This folder lists code for the results in Table 2 and Table 3, Figure B.1 <br />
One only needs to run the code file Mulchpaper.m to get the results <br />

## Analyzing the corrective tax and uncertainty
This folder lists codes for the results in Tables 4, 5, C1, and C2 and Figure C1 <br />
One only needs to run the code file MulchpaperExtension.m to get the results <br />

## Mulch Paper Risk Aversion plot.ipynb
Figure 3 is developed by running the Python Script Mulch Paper Risk Aversion plot.ipynb
